            <p>
                I'm ambitious, creative, innovation-focused, avid programmer,
                and experienced in high-impact startups. I have a dual background in
                business and software development which created the foundation to
                lead and support technical teams through effective communication
                to produce high-quality solutions.
            </p>
            <p>  
                I have build apps from scratch, collaborating with designers, marketers,
                and full-stack engineers to build world-class technology.
                In addition, I have built web apps, hybrid mobile
                and smartwatch applications with their backends using various frameworks.
            </p>
            <p>  
                I'm passionate about opportunities that improve my skill
                sets and challenge me, specfically working under experienced and collaborative
                team members, to accomplish the impossible.
